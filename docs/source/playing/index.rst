Playing Pysimgame
=================

pysimgame is not directly playable, as you need to have a game to play
it.

The idea is that you can download games from github, or create one if
you have a simulation file compatible with pysimgame simulation libraries.

To start pysimgame menu, just start the command::

    python -m pysimgame

Then you will arrive in the menu where you can continue your games
and where you can also start new games.
